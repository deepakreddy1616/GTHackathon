🚀 InsightFlow: The Automated Insight Engine

Tagline: A fully automated analytics pipeline that ingests raw CSV logs and transforms them into AI-powered PPTX & PDF reports — complete with charts, anomalies, and natural-language insights.

1. The Problem (Real World Scenario)
📌 Context

In the AdTech world, thousands of campaigns run across multiple locations every day.
But Account Managers still spend 4–6 hours per week downloading CSV files, cleaning data, building charts, and copy-pasting screenshots into client reports.

😩 The Pain Point

Reporting is manual, slow, and boring

Errors easily happen

Performance issues (budget waste, traffic drops, spike events) may be discovered too late

Clients wait days to get simple insights

💡 My Solution — InsightFlow

InsightFlow is an automated reporting robot.

You drop a raw CSV file → the system:

Cleans data

Detects anomalies

Generates beautiful charts

Writes an AI explanation

Exports a fully formatted PPTX + PDF

All in under 30 seconds, without ANY manual work.

InsightFlow turns raw data → decision-ready insights.

2. Expected End Result
For the User:
🟦 Input

Upload or drop a raw CSV containing campaign logs (clicks, impressions, revenue, location, date).

🟨 Action

Wait ~30 seconds while InsightFlow processes the data.

🟩 Output

A professionally designed PPTX + PDF containing:

📈 Daily Clicks Trend

📊 CTR Trend

💰 Revenue Trend

🔴 Automatically Detected Anomalies (e.g., “Clicks spiked 200% on Nov 14”)

🤖 AI-Written Executive Summary explaining what happened

📌 Optional: Recommendations generated by AI

This turns anyone — even non-analysts — into insight-ready decision makers.

3. Technical Approach

I designed InsightFlow to mimic a real production analytics pipeline, not just a script.

🏗️ System Architecture Overview
Raw CSV → Data Cleaner → KPI Calculator → Anomaly Detector 
       → Chart Engine → AI Summary Generator → PPTX/PDF Export

1️⃣ Ingestion & Cleaning

Reads raw CSV (supports future SQL/DB ingestion)

Normalizes dates, fills missing values

Converts locations, regions, timestamps into consistent formats

I chose Pandas (or Polars optionally) for easy manipulation.

2️⃣ Anomaly Detection (Automatic Outliers)

To detect unusual days, I implemented a simple statistical Z-Score detector:

High anomalies: clicks >> mean

Low anomalies: clicks << mean

Detected anomalies appear as red dots on charts.

3️⃣ AI-Powered Executive Summary

InsightFlow sends key metrics + anomaly metadata to an LLM (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini).

The model writes:

A clean summary

Performance explanation

Recommendations

A guardrail ensures:
If AI cannot justify something, it says “Unknown” instead of hallucinating.

4️⃣ Reporting Engine

The final report is built using:

python-pptx (slides, charts, summary)

LibreOffice for PDF export

Optional FastAPI Web UI (upload → download)

The output is pixel-perfect and client-ready.

4. Tech Stack
Layer	Tool
Language	Python 3.11
Data Processing	Pandas / Polars
Anomaly Detection	Z-Score statistics
AI Model	OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (via API key)
Charts	Matplotlib
Reporting	python-pptx + LibreOffice PDF export
Web UI (optional)	FastAPI + Uvicorn
Environment	Virtualenv
5. Challenges & Learnings
🧩 Challenge 1 — AI Hallucinations

Problem: If given vague data, the AI sometimes guessed reasons (“Weather caused drop”).
Solution:
I added a Strict Context Prompt:

“Only use numbers given. If you don’t know the reason, respond: ‘Unknown’.”

This removed misleading insights.

🧩 Challenge 2 — Time Series Missing Dates

Real CSV files often skip days → graphs break.
I fixed this by automatically:

Reindexing dates

Filling zeros where data was missing

Charts now look smooth and consistent.

🧩 Challenge 3 — PPTX to PDF Conversion

LibreOffice CLI was not detected on Windows at first.
I learned to:

Add LibreOffice to PATH

Use the --headless flag

Force output directory

Now PDF export is 100% automated.

7. How to Run
🟦 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/deepakreddy1616/GTHackathon
cd InsightFlow

🟨 2. Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate

🟩 3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

🟧 4. Add Your OpenAI API Key

Windows PowerShell:

setx OPENAI_API_KEY 


Restart terminal, then verify:

echo $Env:OPENAI_API_KEY

🟥 5. Run the Report Generator
python insightflow_run.py


This reads sample_data.csv and creates:

output/InsightFlow_Report.pptx
output/InsightFlow_Report.pdf



http://localhost:8000


Upload a CSV → download the PPTX/PDF.
